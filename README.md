### About
This repository includes scripts and notebooks for developing a national supratidal forest extent workflow for Australia specific for integration within [Digital Earth Australia](https://www.dea.ga.gov.au/). The project is being led by [Dr Chris Owers](https://www.newcastle.edu.au/profile/chris-owers), [Dr Jeff Kelleway](https://scholars.uow.edu.au/jeffrey-kelleway) and [Dr Rafael Carvalho](https://www.newcastle.edu.au/profile/rafael-carvalho)

### What is a supratidal forest?
Supratidal forests are a coastal ecosystem dominated by the salt-tolerant angiosperm genus Casuarina (family: CASUARINACEA). Supratidal forests are often found near the upper limit of the tidal inundation mostly at supratidal elevations experiencing some estuarine connectivity, sometimes abutting or transitioning from adjacent coastal communities such as saltmarshes or mangroves at lower elevation. (Under development Jeff/Raf)

### Why are supratidal forest important?
Supratidal forests play an important role in organic carbon (Corg) accumulation and storage in subtropical and temperate Australia. It is estimated that these forests stock an average of 143 ± 61 Mg Corg/ha above ground and 241 ± 136 Mg Corg/ha at 1 metre-depth below ground. These stocks are within the range of values reported for other coastal ecosystems such as mangroves, saltmarshes and seagrass beds, and therefore of significance for global carbon cycling. (Under development Jeff/Raf)

### Where do they occur?
Forests and woodlands of the genus Casuarina cover approximately 16,500 km2 of the Australian continent. However, much of this coverage occurs outside coastal catchments. In coastal settings, supratidal forests are normally found at elevations below 5 meters above mean sea level, although this ecological community can be observed at much higher elevations and frequently in the intertidal zone.

Casuarina glauca occurs on low-lying alluvial floodplains distributed along the temperate coast of NSW and the sub-tropical coast of Queensland. Casuarina equisetifolia has a native distribution across coastal northeast Australia, whereas Casuarina obesa has a native range predominantly across the southern part of Western Australia. Both C. equisetifolia and C. obesa appear less dominant within the estuarine zone of their respective ranges, in part due to competition with other genus Melaleuca (family: MYRTACEAE) in particular. (Under development Jeff/Raf)

### How can we map them?
Supratidal forests in Australia are mapped within the coastal areas defined by Geoscience Australia (ga_summary_grid_c3_coastal.geojson) by considering only the woody vegetation between 1 and 5 m above Australian Height Datum (approximately mean sea level) excluding other woody vegetation such as mangrove (ga_ls_mangrove_cover_cyear_3).

Datasets used to map the supratidal forests at continental scale include; i) SRTM Elevation (for completeness); ii) Woody vegetation cover from XXXX (link to dataset). A threshold of 0.5 - 1 is applied to the woody vegetation dataset. (Under development Chris/Raf/Jeff)
